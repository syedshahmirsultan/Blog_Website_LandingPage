# 📝 Blog Website Landing Page

This is a simple landing page for a blog website. This page serves as the entry point for visitors to explore the content on the blog website.

## Technologies Used:

• [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/blog/next•14-2)
• [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
• [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
• [React-Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
• [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/)

I use Next.js as the framework and TypeScript as the programming language for writing the programs. For styling, I use Tailwind CSS and also incorporate React-Icons to enhance the website's visual appeal. Sanity is utilized as the Content Management System (CMS) to enter data manually, which is then rendered on the website.
